    <h3>Why Libki?</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Web-based Interface:</strong> Libkiâ€™s administration interface is based on standards-compliant World Wide Web technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript, making Libki a platform-independent solution. The administration system is web-based for easy use from any operating system, install once and access it from anywhere on your network.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Free Open Source Software:</strong> Libki is distributed under the open-source General Public License (GPL). More information on the GPL can be found here.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No Vendor Lock-in:</strong> A great benefit of Open Source Software is the lack of vendor lock-in: anyone is free to install and use Libki themselves if the have the necessary skills, or they may purchase support or development services.
