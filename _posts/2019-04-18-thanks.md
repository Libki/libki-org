title:  "Coming Attractions: User names and categories!"
---

I would like to thank Bouzid Fergani from InLibro for all his recent pull requests!
I will be working to get them all integrated into the official distribution.

Already pushed is his enhancement which adds user fields for first and last name, and user category.
These fields can be auto-populated when using SSO via SIP!
I've also added a manual editor for anyone not using SIP SSO.

Expect to see this enhancement in Libki 19.06!
